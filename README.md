"# bookbub-dash-app" 

A small "dashboard" script I wrote as an add-on for a job app. Uses plotly / dash in python.

https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/bookb-app

Turns data from a bookbub info page into bar charts on advertising costs and average return by genre and lets
users toggle between U.S. only, international data, or combined data. Displays 3 charts to show
1) subscriber by genre
2) fee by promotional price
3) cost per free download
